## About this Project üìä

This project is a **Brazilian Export Dashboard**, developed with **R Shiny** and **bs4Dash** to provide an interactive platform for exploring Brazil's export data between 2011 and 2020. 

The dashboard was created as part of my coursework for **CE062-Dashboards** at the **Federal University of Paran√° (UFPR)** under the guidance of Professor Walmes Zeviane. The goal of this project is to offer data-driven insights into Brazil‚Äôs export activities, detailing exported products, target countries, economic regions, and other relevant information for analysis.

### Dataset üìà

The dataset used in this project is the **Brazilian Exports Dataset**, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugovallejo/brazil-exports?select=exportacao_full.csv), originally shared by Hugo Angulo. It includes monthly export data from 2010 to 2020, with information on exporting municipalities, destination countries, export revenue, and product weights.

Given the dataset's size (over 13 million rows), data was aggregated by year and optimized for performance. Additional auxiliary tables were sourced from Brazil‚Äôs **Ministry of Development, Industry, Commerce, and Services (MDIC)** to aid in the translation of country names and product categories, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
